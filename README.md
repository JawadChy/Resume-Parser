### Application Information
Our Resume Parser app has an interface for two types of users, an applicant and a recruiter. 
Applicants post their resumes which we store in our database and Recruiters can search for employees based on their qualifications by inputing a keyword into the search bar. On our backend, we search all the stored "applications" or Resumes and return a list of all Resumes that include the keyword in them, making recruiting infinitely simpler for employers.
